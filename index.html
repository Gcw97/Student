      <h2>What is Cryptocurrency</h2>
       
      
          <p>Cryptocurrency AKA "crypto" is a digitcal currency that can be used to buy goods and services. This interesting technology was created by a user named "Satoshi" which is actually a mysterious alias with no previous connections to one person.
            These currencies are usually company issued tokens which could be compared to casino chips or arcade tokens.
            It uses and online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions. Cryptography is a method of protecting vital information and communications via the use of codes. This ensures that only those for whom the information was intended for may access it.
            In layman's terms a computers uses algorithims to transforms messages to where the are very difficult to decipher. Once the message reaches it's destination it is descrambled using various techniques.
            Cryptocurrency uses a decentralized technology called a blockchain that is spread across various computers that manages and records transactions. The top 10 crpytocurrencies currently on the market are Bitcoin,
            Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, and Binance Coin.

      <h2>Pros of Cryptocurrency</h2>
        
      
          <p> The overall appeal of this new technology is primarily the integrity and security. Benfits include user autonomy which ensures users more control
      of their currency unlike fiat currencies that are under an intermediary authority such as a bank or government. This would elimate things such as banking fees
            such as overdraft, minimum balance, deposit fees, and more. The currency is peer to peer focus making it very accessible making it easy for users
            to send and receive payments virtually anywhere in the world. Also discretion is a point because a user may remain
      some what annonoymous because transaction addresses are changed which each successful process. There are a wide arrange of benfits of this new technology however
      with the good there is always some bad.

      <h2>Cons of Cryptocurrency</h2>
        
          <p>The primary drawback behind crypto would be its scalability. It has no essential cash flow which all successful businesses usually 
      thrive from. It also is unable to compete with the speed of transactions such as VISA. The cybersecurity behind the technology also looms its success.
      Since it is a digital currency it is subject to breaches and hacks. Along with the difficulty to trace the currency because of it's discretion it could lead to investors
      losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Also unlike the U.S. dollar which is backed by gold cryptocurrent has no inherent value. The overall flow could be thrown off considering the logistics as technology improves.
       Plus along with these issues the currency is decentralized; While some may see as a pro it has no regulations. This means that the federal government has no say. Some countries such as China went to the extent of banning the use of cryptocurrency.
       No supervision leads to a future that is difficult to predict. </p>

      <h2> How to Buy,Sell, and Invest</h2>
      
      
          <p> To purchase cryptocurrency you will need a wallet which falls into two categories which is hot and cold. A cold wallet is basically a flashdrive which can hold the currency phsyically 
      off the internet and is accessible via password. The opposite which is a hot wallet may be accessible via an online app. Some currencies such as Bitcoin may be purchased with U.S. dollars while others require you pay with bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. The first
             step is to decide where to buy the currency in which you would need an exchange and traditional brokers. Apps like Robinhood or Coinbase is where you can get started investing.
             Once you make your purchase you must decide your overall plan to use the asset. Some choose to day trade while others choose to sit on the asset to watch it grow over time. When investing
             it's best to do your research different currencies have different values. Dogecoin value currently isn't worth no where close to a cent while one Bitcoin is currently as of date worth 32,743.91 U.S. dollars. Imagine 
           if you had just bought one Bitcoin in the summer of 2020 when it was about 7,000 dollars. Although the numbers look exciting one must remember that cryptocurrency is a very
          volatile market and as easily you can make money you can lose.

      <h2>The Future of Cryptocurrency</h2>
      
          <p> 2020 was a very eccentric year for crytocurrency. The pandemic opened the worlds eyes as to how easily
             are day to day routine could drastically change in an instance. This opened up conceptual understand and technical curiosity
            to these blockchains and the endless possibilities they can achieve. Mainstream businesses are starting to adapt the blockchain 
            to their model structure and more supporters start to pour in. However that does not remove the uncertainty behind the blockchain and the place it will take in our world's economic structure.
            Come 2021 this technology will begin to stretch beyond financial services and start to attract sectors such as Healthcare, transportation, logistics and many more.
           Supporters see cryptocurreny such as Bitcoin as the future and there is an uproar to purchases them before they come more and more valuable. Although the future may seem bright for Cryptocurrency it is always risky to predict the future.
